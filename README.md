## why
i started leaning java just for making some minecraft things (like clients, plugins etc) so this is my first not pasted and custom base client :)

## building
to build client yourself you can use

```
gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
```
```
gradlew build
```
also don't forget that if you wanna build client you need some things like:
* jdk 8 
* a little bit of brain if you get errors


## TODO
* settings 
* config
* target renders
* more cool gui renders
* fixing crashes
* main menu shaders

## contributing
i will be glad to see you making changes to client and posting them in pull requests so uh yeah

WARNING: **code might be a little bit bad because this is my first time making client**
